https://www.codewars.com/kata/simple-validation-of-a-username-with-regex/train/javascript

## Problem domain
Write a simple regex to validate a username. Allowed characters are:
- lowercase letters,
- numbers,
- underscore
- and the length should be between 4 and 16 characters (both included).

## Solution:
1. Write a function validateUsr with parameter username.
2. Using regex syntax, start at the beginning of the string with ^, look for the lowercase letters with a-z, the numbers 0-9, and the underscore _
3. Give the characters a min and max length with {min, max}
