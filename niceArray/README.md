***Codewars Challenge 08/21/2018
***Task:
Write a function named isNice/IsNice that returns true if its array argument is a Nice array, else false. You should also return false if input array has no elements.

***Output:
Will be an array where for every value n in the array, there is also an element n-1 or n+1.

***Example: 
[2,10,9,3] is Nice array because

2=3-1
10=9+1
3=2+1
9=10-1
